There are some changes you have to do in your spec file
in order to test your module during the autobuild.

<h3>Update neededforbuild</h3>

Your <tt>neededforbuild</tt> should look like this.
You probably don't need any other packages for the build.

<pre>
    # neededforbuild
    autoconf automake ycpdoc
    yast2-testsuite dejagnu expect tcl
    yast2-base libycp liby2 libyui libscr
    yast2-core-wfm yast2-core-scr yast2-agent-system
</pre>

<h3>Update %build and %install stages</h3>

The %build and %install stages should also look like this.
And again, you probably don't need to add anything.

<pre>
    %build
    ./configure
    make

    %install
    make install
    make check
    %{?suse_check}
</pre>

<h3>Building</h3>

Create new spec file and package and use your usual way of
building package.

<pre>
    bash$ make -f Makefile.cvs
    bash$ make package
    bash$ cd package
    bash$ abuild...
</pre>

If everything succeed, check in the package.

<h3>Hunting bugs</h3>

Testsuite failed during auto build. What to do now?
These steps should help you to hunt the bug:

<ul>
<li>Reproduce the bug with "<tt>build yourpackage</tt>"
<li>Do "<tt>chroot /tmp/buildsystem.host.user</tt>", or "<tt>chroot /abuild/buildsystem.host.user</tt>"
<li>CD to /usr/src/packages/BUILD/yourpackage/testsuite/tests/
<li>Do "<tt>mount /proc</tt>"
<li>Run "<tt>/usr/lib/YaST2/bin/y2base failedtest.ycp scr</tt>"
<li>Take a look at "<tt>/var/log/YaST2/y2log</tt>"
</ul>

Now you have the same situation as usual. You have failing script,
possibility of testing and the y2log output.

<p>
Good luck!
